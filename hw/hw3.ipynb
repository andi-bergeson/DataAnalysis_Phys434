    "2a) The pdf of the sum of two identical exponential distributions is the same as the convolution of two idendical distributions, $\\lambda^{2}xe^{-\\lambda x}$. This is an Erlang distribution if shape parameter k is equal to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2b) The pdf of the ratio of two zero-mean unity variance normal distributions is the Cauchy distribution, $\\frac{1}{\\pi(x^{2}+1)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2c) The z value for X and Y coordinates correspond to their respective normal distribution evaluated at their particular x (or y) value. The amplitude of any vector is $\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$, thus the amplitude of this vector is the square root of the addition of the square pdf's. Some normalization needs to occur before the actual value of the amplitude makes sense, but the shape (pdf) of this vector should also be a Gaussian."
